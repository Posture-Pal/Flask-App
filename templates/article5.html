            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Proper Posture</h2>
            <p>Maintaining the correct posture is crucial for ensuring your body works efficiently and feels
                comfortable. Follow these steps to get into a good posture position:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stand Up Straight:</strong> Start by standing tall without over-stretching. Imagine a string
                    pulling you upwards from the top of your head.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Your Head Aligned:</strong> Your head should be upright, not tilted forward or back.
                    Look straight ahead, keeping your eyes on the horizon line.</li>
                <li><strong>Relax Your Shoulders:</strong> Let your shoulders drop naturally while pulling them slightly
                    back. Avoid hunching or forcing them down.</li>
                <li><strong>Engage Your Core:</strong> Gently tuck your bottom under and pull your tummy in to engage
                    your abdominal muscles. This helps stabilize your spine.</li>
                <li><strong>Relax Your Knees:</strong> Avoid locking your knees back. Keep them slightly bent to
                    maintain a natural stance.</li>
                <li><strong>Position Your Arms:</strong> Let your arms hang naturally by your sides, with palms facing
                    inwards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Practice these steps regularly until they feel natural. Over time, good posture will become second
                nature.</p>

            <h2>Adjusting Your Posture While Sitting</h2>
            <p>Correct sitting posture is just as important as standing. To sit properly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose a Supportive Chair:</strong> Use a chair with good back support. Sit all the way back
                    so that your lower back is supported.</li>
                <li><strong>Feet Flat on the Floor:</strong> Keep your feet flat on the ground and your knees at a right
                    angle. Avoid crossing your legs for extended periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Align Your Spine:</strong> Sit with your back straight and shoulders relaxed. Avoid
                    slouching forward or leaning too far back.</li>
                <li><strong>Position Your Screen:</strong> If working at a desk, ensure your screen is at eye level to
                    prevent neck strain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember to take regular breaks to stand, stretch, and move around to prevent stiffness.</p>
